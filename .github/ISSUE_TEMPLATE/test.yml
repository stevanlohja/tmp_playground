      description: What specific, critical user problem does this solve? Why does this need to exist?
      placeholder: "Users want to journal digitally but fear their private thoughts being read by platform providers, advertisers, or hackers. Existing 'private' apps rely on trust, not proof."

      description: Who is the primary user (persona)? What specific, tangible value do they get from this DApp's *privacy* features?
      placeholder: |
        - **Target User:** Journalists, whistleblowers, medical patients, or anyone journaling sensitive personal thoughts.
        - **Privacy Value:** This DApp provides *provable, trustless privacy*. The user doesn't have to trust us; they can be 100% certain their entries are encrypted and theirs alone, with the *option* to prove authorship later (via ZK) if they choose.

      placeholder: |
        - **As a user,** I want to write and edit an entry, so that it is encrypted and saved privately.
        - **As a user,** I want to be the only one who can decrypt and read my entries, so that I have full privacy.
        - **As a user,** I want to (optionally) generate a ZK-proof, so that I can prove I wrote an entry on a certain date without revealing its content.
        - **As a user,** I want to (optionally) share a specific entry with another user, so that they can decrypt and read only that single entry.
